        "\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy is a Python library that is used for scientific computing, and it provides a powerful array data type called ndarray. The ndarray can be used to store homogeneous data (i.e., data of the same type) in a multidimensional array.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy supports a range of data types that can be used with the ndarray. These data types are specified using a single character code, which is used as a shorthand notation for the data type. Here are some of the most commonly used data types in NumPy:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. int: integer( used to represent integer numbers. e.g. -1, -2, -3)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. float: floating-point number(used to represent real numbers. e.g. 1.2, 42.42)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. complex: complex number( used to represent complex numbers. e.g. 1.0 + 2.0j, 1.5 + 2.5j)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. bool: Boolean (True or False)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. object: Python object\n",
        "\n",
        "6. string_: fixed-length string( used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. e.g. \"ABCD\")\n",
        "\n",
        "7. unicode_: fixed-length Unicode string\n",
        "\n",
        "Each data type has a corresponding bit depth, which determines the range of values that can be represented by the data type. For example, an int16 can represent integers between -32,768 and 32,767, while an int64 can represent integers between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.\n",
        "\n",
        "NumPy also supports structured data types, which allow you to create arrays with fields that can be different data types. Structured data types are specified using a dictionary with keys that represent field names and values that represent the data type of each field.\n",

        "\n",

It's important to choose the appropriate data type based on the type of data being stored to optimize memory usage and computation speed.\n",
